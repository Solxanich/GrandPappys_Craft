# GrandPappys_Craft
Minecraft Modpack Repository for GrandPappy's Craft
GrandPappy’s Craft is the penultimate 1.12 RPG experience. Featuring a light story, vocational system, 250+ mods, 1000+ unique mobs, and 450+ quests, there is plenty of fun to be had for the whole family.

The Story:
GrandPappy’s Craft is a fictitious story about the four grandkids of grandpappy Solxan, and how they learn to adapt, cooperate and survive after a terrible accident [warning: you will die at least once]. You, and your team of up to three other players, will play out their story as they try to return home. Take advantage of powerful mods to shape the world, select story roles through content-unlocking vocations, and share your findings with your “siblings and cousins” to aid in your journey, all while under the caring gaze of grandpappy Solxan. 

The Vocational System:
GrandPappy’s Craft uses a vocational system (via Game Stages and Lord Craft) to segment content into four balanced basic roles: The Engineer, The Outcast, The Farmer, and The Bard. Each role has their own unique sub-specializations they will gain access to through research, as well as opportunities to cooperate with other roles through gifting in-game items and ‘common knowledge’ content. Although designed for multiplayer teams of four, the vocation system also provides means to play with fewer players. For more information on vocations, refer to the mod unlock list provided.

Specs, Server Setup, and Other Recommendations:
This mudpack is RAM intensive. The recommended RAM is 8 to 10 GB for clients; for servers, use 5 GB plus one per player expected. 
The installation includes a server settings folder; the files in this folder can be used to start the server with the appropriate settings for a smoother experience.  In addition, it is recommended to swap to Peko’s build for LittleMaidMobs for both client and server to resolve missing texture errors on a dedicated server. For more information on Peko’s Build, please refer to the following by Doll Junkie: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BFxVeVZNwOyJYI4s5h9oTPkn07E4ttMDg0knls5-JY/edit 
It is recommended to run this mudpack with Optifine and usage of internal shaders. Some mod shaders (such as Betweenlands Shaders) may be incompatible with shader packs. 

Mod Unlock List:
Due to the heavy use of Game Stages, and the ease of access of information, the following list was created to breakdown what mods unlock with each stage and decision.
